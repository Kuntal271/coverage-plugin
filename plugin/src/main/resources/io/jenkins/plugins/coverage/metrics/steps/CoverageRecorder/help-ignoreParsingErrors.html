<div>
    This toggle determines if the coverage plugin should ignore parsing errors during processing of the coverage
    reports or if it should fail fast with an exception. By default, this toggle is disabled and the
    parsers will fail fast. This helps to identify bugs in the parser or in the coverage tool execution.
    If you would rather like to ignore parsing errors, please tick this checkbox. Please note that in this
    case the parser results might be incomplete or even wrong.
